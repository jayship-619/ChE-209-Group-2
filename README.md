# Polymer Simulation Project  
*Molecular Dynamics of a Three-Arm Polymer Using LAMMPS*

---

### 1. Overview

This repository contains all the necessary input files, scripts, and output data for conducting a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of a **three-arm polymer structure**.  
The project was developed as part of a computational materials research exercise focusing on polymer chain conformations, dynamics, and thermodynamic stability under varying simulation conditions.

All simulations were carried out using the **LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator)** package.  
The workflow includes **polymer structure generation**, **simulation execution**, and **post-processing analysis** of results such as the *radius of gyration* and *chain mobility*.

### 2. Scientific Background

Polymers are complex macromolecules whose properties depend on their molecular architecture and interactions.  
In this study, a **three-arm polymer** (a simple model of a star-shaped polymer) was chosen to investigate the effect of chain branching on conformational stability and diffusion behavior.

The **radius of gyration (Rg)** and **end-to-end distance** are key structural descriptors in polymer physics that provide insights into how the polymer folds and responds to temperature or interaction potentials.

### 4. Methodology

1. **Polymer Generation**  
   The initial polymer configuration was generated using the `polymer_gen.py` script, which defines atomic positions, bond lengths, and angles.  
   This script outputs the `three_arm_polymer.data` file.

2. **Simulation Setup**  
   The input script `alpha_polymer.in` defines the simulation parameters, including:
   - Force field type (e.g., Lennard-Jones or FENE)
   - Thermostat (e.g., Nose–Hoover)
   - Timestep and total simulation duration
   - Output frequencies for trajectory and thermodynamic data

3. **Execution**  
   The simulation is executed using:
   ```bash
   bash run_simulation.sh
   ```
   This script launches LAMMPS and redirects standard and error outputs to `.out` and `.err` files.

4. **Post-Processing**  
   After the run, the trajectory file (`.lammpstrj`) is analyzed using `compute.py`, which calculates:
   - Radius of gyration (Rg)
   - End-to-end distance
   - Mean-squared displacement (optional)
   - Energy fluctuations

### 5. Results and Discussion

Preliminary simulation results show that the **three-arm polymer** exhibits compact and stable conformations after equilibration, indicating favorable intramolecular interactions.  

Key findings:
- The **radius of gyration (Rg)** reached a steady-state average value, suggesting equilibrium was achieved.
- **Trajectory analysis** showed consistent rotational and translational motion among the polymer arms.
- **Temperature and energy fluctuations** were within acceptable limits, confirming numerical stability.

The results demonstrate that branched polymer architectures (like the three-arm structure) tend to have a smaller Rg compared to linear chains of the same molecular weight, consistent with theoretical polymer physics models.

Further analysis may involve:
- Varying arm lengths to study their effect on diffusion coefficients.
- Simulating under different temperatures or solvent conditions.
- Comparing results with experimental data or literature.
